Who are the public or private subjects who study or work with Artificial Intelligence in Italy?

With "Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem" we want to map the Italian producers and users of AI solutions (startups, companies, public and private research entities, etc), to facilitate the construction of relationships and the sharing of knowledge.

We want to create an ecosystem that facilitates the progress of Artificial Intelligence and that allows Italy to have the size of its strengths in the field of AI.

In addition to producing the material accompanying the White Paper on AI in the Public Administration, the information collected will serve to populate a public database.

If you know of anyone in Italy that is currently developing or using AI solutions please forward them the [link to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5CeEfvCPvlx6dOg36vEp5cF2D7nNb0JagA_tQ4PZwUQknGQ/viewform) to help us mapping the AI ecosystem in the country.
