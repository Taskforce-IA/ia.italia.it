## Change bureaucracy, use intelligence! ##

After the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence at the service of citizens, we are developing experimentations to promote Open Innovation paths between administrations and companies, aimed at modernizing processes, services and products of the public administration through Artificial Intelligence.

<a name="cosa"></a>
## What is it? ##
<b>"Use intelligence"</b> is a co-planning program, promoted by the AgID and dedicated to innovative companies that use Artificial Intelligence as a backbone of their service offerings. For innovative companies, the final objective of the path is to help changing the way public administrations work by proposing solutions that can improve internal processes and services for the citizens. 
The call promoted by the AgID in collaboration with Tree and aimed at innovative companies expired on September 15, 2018.

### Project scouting
After the [event](../../evento-21marzo) on March 21, 2018, we opened the scouting phase of possible projects of Artificial Intelligence within public administrations.
Are you a PA interested in projects related to the development of IA solutions? Write to <intelligenza-artificiale@agid.gov.it> detailing goals, technological solutions and current project development roadmap and we will contact you for more information.

\* *The projects have concerned AI applications for **environmental matters** (climate change, study of atmospheric events, video surveillance platforms with AI systems with predictive logic, risk forecasting, decision support systems), **healthcare** (Livelabs, Reality Mining applied to chronic diseases, management of health data, integration of digital services), **cultural heritage** (application of big data algorithms to inhomogeneous database systems), to transport (studies on traffic flows with IA solutions in a previsional view), **skills and services for the citizen** (chatbots that exploit Machine Learning algorithms based on neural networks).*
